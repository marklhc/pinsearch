Description: A function to automate specification search for identify 
    noninvariant items in factorial invariance analyses. The package supports
    continuous indicators with loadings, intercepts, residuals (uniqueness),
    and residual covariances invariance, and ordered categorical indicators 
    with loadings, thresholds, and residual covariances invariance.
