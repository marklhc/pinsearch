# pinsearch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pinsearch is to automate the process of performing specification search in identifying noninvariant items to arrive at a partial factorial invariance model. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of pinsearch from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("pinsearch") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

You can install the development version of pinsearch from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marklhc/pinsearch")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(pinsearch)
library(lavaan)
HS.model <- '  visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
              speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '
# Output the final partial invariance model, and the noninvariant items
pinSearch(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939, 
          group = "school", type = "intercepts")
```
